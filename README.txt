An idea Jason had: let's take a hashtag, like #chi2016, and see if all the tags from that hashtag are from the same place, and then we can add the same geotag to all of them in order to get a bunch more geotags.

Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to work too well - for #chi2016, out of 311 tweets, there was 1 with coordinates (in Japan) and 5 more with just a place (none of which were at CHI 2016; they were all talking about CHI from somewhere
else). 

Tried it for #cmu (3/1000 had any place tag at all; 2 in michigan, 1 in france); #SuperBowl (19/1000 had place tags, 5 of which were in Atlanta, but 14 were all other places); #SDCC (I forget the numbers but also bad).
